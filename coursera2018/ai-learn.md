prediction = X * theta
prediction = sigoid (X * theta)



SVM
A large C parameter tells the SVM to try to classify all the examples correctly.

###### Classification and Representation ######
1. discrete value,discrete-valued.
2. generalize to. Most of what we say here will also generalize to the multiple-class case.
3. denote. 0 is also called the negative class, and 1 the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols “-” and “+.”
4. corresponding. Given x(i), the corresponding y(i)  is also called the label for the training example.
5. sigmoid.
6. logistic
7. convex. convex function

###### Solving the Problem of Overfitting ######
1. leftmost.rightmost
2. naive ,naively
